- GPT-4 + Wolfram Alpha can sometimes get stuck sending the same error query, which can only be stopped manually.

## 2. Test Cases

### Problem 1

**Trial 1, 2, 3 ** Note: the result is almost the same.

Using Wolfram

REQUEST TO WOLFRAM
```
{
  "input": "simplify (sqrt(160)/sqrt(252))*(sqrt(245)/sqrt(108))"
}
```
RESPONSE FROM WOLFRAM
```

Query:
"simplify (sqrt(160)/sqrt(252))*(sqrt(245)/sqrt(108))"

Input interpretation:
simplify | sqrt(160)/sqrt(252)×sqrt(245)/sqrt(108)

Results:
(5 sqrt(42))/27

(5 sqrt(14/3))/9

Decimal approximation:
1.2001371663718259686974013770533327143898526494552493610576582218...

```
The completely simplified and rationalized form of the expression 

$$\frac{\sqrt{160}}{\sqrt{252}}\times\frac{\sqrt{245}}{\sqrt{108}}$$

is 

$$\frac{5\sqrt{14/3}}{9}$$

In decimal form, this is approximately 1.2001371663718259686974013770533327143898526494552493610576582218.


### Problem 2
 There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?

**Trial 1**
This is a problem of set theory and can be solved using the principle of inclusion and exclusion. The principle of inclusion and exclusion states that for any three sets A, B, and C, the size of their union can be found by adding the sizes of the sets, then subtracting the sizes of the pairwise intersections, and finally adding back the size of the intersection of all three.

Let's denote:
- A as the set of people wearing sunglasses
- B as the set of people wearing bathing suits
- C as the set of people wearing a hat

We know that:
- |A| = 110 (people wearing sunglasses)
- |B| = 70 (people wearing bathing suits)
- |C| = 95 (people wearing a hat)
- |A ∩ B| = 30 (people wearing both sunglasses and bathing suits)
- |A ∩ C| = 40 (people wearing both sunglasses and a hat)
- |B ∩ C| = 25 (people wearing both bathing suits and a hat)
- |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 190 (total people on the beach)

We can find the number of people wearing all three items (|A ∩ B ∩ C|) by rearranging the formula of the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∪ B ∪ C|

Let's calculate this.

Apologies for the confusion. The symbol "C" is a built-in constant in the Wolfram Language, representing the speed of light, and cannot be reassigned. Let's use different symbols to represent the sets:

- S for the set of people wearing sunglasses
- B for the set of people wearing bathing suits
- H for the set of people wearing a hat

Let's calculate again.

```
{
  "input": "S = 110; B = 70; H = 95; SB = 30; SH = 40; BH = 25; SBH_total = 190; SBH = S + B + H - SB - SH - BH + SBH_total; SBH"
}
```

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was an error in the calculation. The variable "SBH_total" was not correctly replaced with its value. Let's try again.

}
```

**Trial 2**

This is a problem of set theory, specifically a problem involving the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

The principle of inclusion and exclusion states that for any three sets A, B, and C, the size of the union of the sets is given by:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

In this case, we have:

- |A| = 110 (people wearing sunglasses)
- |B| = 70 (people wearing bathing suits)
- |C| = 95 (people wearing a hat)
- |A ∩ B| = 30 (people wearing both sunglasses and bathing suits)
- |A ∩ C| = 40 (people wearing both sunglasses and a hat)
- |B ∩ C| = 25 (people wearing both bathing suits and a hat)
- |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 190 (total people on the beach)

We can solve for |A ∩ B ∩ C| (people wearing all three items) by rearranging the equation:

|A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∪ B ∪ C|

Let's calculate this.

Wolfram|Alpha website result for "110 + 70 + 95 - 30 - 40 - 25 + 190":
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=110+%2B+70+%2B+95+-+30+-+40+-+25+%2B+190
```

The number of people wearing all three items (sunglasses, bathing suits, and a hat) is 370. However, this number is greater than the total number of people on the beach (190), which suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem statement or my calculations. Let's double-check the calculations.

The principle of inclusion and exclusion formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Substituting the given values:

190 = 110 + 70 + 95 - 30 - 40 - 25 + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Solving for |A ∩ B ∩ C| gives:

|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 190 - 110 - 70 - 95 + 30 + 40 + 25

Let's calculate this.

My apologies for the earlier confusion. After correcting the calculation, it turns out that there are 10 people on the beach who are wearing all three items: sunglasses, bathing suits, and a hat.

**Trial 3**

This is a problem of set theory, specifically a problem involving the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

The principle of inclusion and exclusion states that for any three sets A, B, and C, the number of elements in the union of the sets is given by:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

where:
- |A|, |B|, and |C| are the number of elements in sets A, B, and C respectively,
- |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, and |B ∩ C| are the number of elements in the intersection of sets A and B, A and C, and B and C respectively,
- |A ∩ B ∩ C| is the number of elements in the intersection of sets A, B, and C (i.e., elements that are in all three sets).

In this case, we can define the sets as follows:
- Set A is the set of people wearing sunglasses.
- Set B is the set of people wearing bathing suits.
- Set C is the set of people wearing a hat.

We know the following:
- |A| = 110 (people wearing sunglasses)
- |B| = 70 (people wearing bathing suits)
- |C| = 95 (people wearing a hat)
- |A ∩ B| = 30 (people wearing both sunglasses and bathing suits)
- |A ∩ C| = 40 (people wearing both sunglasses and a hat)
- |B ∩ C| = 25 (people wearing both bathing suits and a hat)
- |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 190 (total people on the beach)

We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for |A ∩ B ∩ C|, which represents the number of people wearing all three items (sunglasses, bathing suits, and a hat). 

Let's calculate this.


Request to Wolfram
```
{
  "input": "totalPeople = 190; sunglasses = 110; bathingSuits = 70; hats = 95; sunglassesAndBathingSuits = 30; sunglassesAndHats = 40; bathingSuitsAndHats = 25; allThree = totalPeople - sunglasses - bathingSuits - hats + sunglassesAndBathingSuits + sunglassesAndHats + bathingSuitsAndHats; allThree"
}
```

Response from Wolfram
```
"10"
```
The number of people wearing all three items (sunglasses, bathing suits, and a hat) is 10.
